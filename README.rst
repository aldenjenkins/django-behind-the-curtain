Behind the curtain
==================
Code examples for the talk "Behind the curtain - How Django handles a request" at DjangoCon Europe 2018.

Each sub-directory contains a small Django project.

    * default: a project with default structure and settings, generated with
               `django-admin.py startproject default`
    * simple: a really simple project
    * middlewares: like simple, but with three middlewares

Usage
-----

The only external dependency is Django 2.0.x, meaning you have to use Python 3.4 or higher.

(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You can the change into one of the project directories and run the `server.py` script, which starts a server on 127.0.0.1:8000

(venv) $ cd simple
(venv) $ python server.py

Note that the server exits after handling a single request.
